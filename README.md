A calculator built with typescript, html, css, as well as unit tests written in jest using jsdom. The intention of this project was to highlight my ability to work outside of typical front end frameworks and libraries, as well as to experiment with more complex UI design.

This project was originally written in JS, but was recently refactored into TS. That old file has been kept in the file directory for reference.
