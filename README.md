A calculator built with TypeScript, HTML, CSS, as well as unit tests written in jest using jsdom. The intention of this project was to work outside of typical front end frameworks and libraries, as well as to showcase more complex UI design concepts.

This project was originally written in vanilla JS, but was recently refactored into TS. That old js file has been kept in the file directory for reference.
